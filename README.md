# Baking start and stop scripts

The scripts in these directories can be used to start and stop
tezos nodes and bakers.

start.sh <config> - starts a node/bakers as appropriate
kill.sh <config>  - stops the node/bakers gracefully

See configs for example configurations.

# Mondaynet and Dailynet setup

mondaynet contains setup and maintenance scripts for bakers running
on the mondaynet and dailynet networks. These were designed for use
on Ubuntu instances on AWS.
