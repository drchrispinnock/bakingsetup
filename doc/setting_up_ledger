1. For USB devices access note this:

Use the template 20-hw1.rules in /etc/udev/rules.d/

If you don't get this right, only root will have access to the ledger.

2. You must use the right path and cipher. Note the 0h/0h. Check the 
key hash you get is the expected one.

tezos-client list connected ledgers
tezos-client import secret key ledger_tezos \
	"ledger://kaleidoscopic-uguisu-gripping-nightingale/ed25519/0h/0h"
tezos-client setup ledger to bake for ledger_tezos
tezos-client register key ledger_tezos as delegate

3. You MUST plug the thing into the same port every time.

4. Make sure it is unlocked.

5. Otherwise you will miss endorsements and the endorser might even crash...
