# How to use this fine work
#
1. Setup an Ubuntu AWS host - t3.xlarge, 60GB SSD
Although the scripts will attempt to update software, it is a good
idea to apt update, apt upgrade -y && apt dist-upgrade -y

2. Checkout the startup software and make sure it is in $HOME/startup.

git clone git@github.com:drchrispinnock/bakingsetup
mv bakingsetup startup

3. Set your hostname to something suitable like mondaynet-oregon

edit /etc/hostname

The hostname needs to include mondaynet or dailynet.

4. Run mondaynet-setup.sh <branch>
e.g. bash ./startup/mondaynet/mondaynet-setup.sh
e.g. bash ./startup/mondaynet/mondaynet-setup.sh d0bf56ce

5. Wait. You can log back in on the reboot and look at start-log.txt
tail -f start-log.txt (usually complete in under 30 minutes)
tail -f logs/logfile

6. When the node is synced (this can take some time) get a account from 
the faucet and self-delegate. The account should be called the same 
as the hostname. We will use mondaynet-lon2 here. Use the HOSTNAME.

Go to https://teztnets.xyz/ and go to the latest faucet for mondaynet
Download a json file. Save it as faucet.json on the server.

./tezos/tezos-client activate account mondaynet-lon2 with faucet.json
./tezos/tezos-client register key mondaynet-lon2 as delegate

7. Add a wallet directory for this and preserve it

cd startup/mondaynet
mkdir wallet-mondaynet-lon2
cp ~/.tezos-client/*key* wallet-mondaynet-lon2
cp ~/faucet.json wallet-mondaynet-lon2
git add wallet-mondaynet-lon2
git commit -m "add wallet for lon2" -a
git push

8. Restart
touch ~/.skipbuild
sudo shutdown -r now

Files:
mondaynet-common.conf - a common configuration file that should work
	for all instances, based on hostnames. The key should be called
	the same as the hostname.

wallet-<hostname>     - the initial secret and public keys. These will
	be used to restore the wallet after a network reset.


$HOME files
===========

monday.setup - overrides for variables in the start scripts

.cleanup - if this exists cleanup all sources, rust and so on, and start
	from scratch. This does not clean tezos-node or client dirs though.

.skipbuild - if this exists, do not attempt to get the tezos software

.resetnode - if this exists, skip resetting the node directory

.resetwallet - if this exists, attempt to move keys from this repos to
	the client wallet.


TODO/IMPROVEMENTS
=================

* There is no need to rebuild the software if the branch ID is the same as
the last boot. Maybe look into this. The delay is about 30-40 minutes
as the node rebuilds itself.

* Actually perhaps it would be better to get a tarball of software from
somewhere instead. Then the buildid would be irrelevant.

* There is no reason why this could not be used for dailynet, just I've
littered mondaynet everywhere. If this were a variable somewhere, perhaps
driven by hostname the same logic could be used.
