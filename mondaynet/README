mondaynet-common.conf - a common configuration file that should work
	for all instances, based on hostnames. The key should be called
	the same as the hostname.

wallet-<hostname>     - the initial secret and public keys. These will
	be used to restore the wallet after a network reset.


$HOME files
===========

monday.setup - overrides for variables in the start scripts

.cleanup - if this exists cleanup all sources, rust and so on, and start
	from scratch. This does not clean tezos-node or client dirs though.

.firstrun - set by the script. If not present, attempt to install packages
	and rust

.skipbuild - if this exists, do not attempt to get the tezos software

.skipreset - if this exists, skip resetting the wallet and node directory

.resetwallet - if this exists
